StarterKit-iOS
==============

This project serves as an example of integrating the ROXIMITY SDK into a basic XCode project. This project uses cocoapods to manage dependancies (AFNetworking). To successfully build this project you will first need to install cocoapods and run the 'pod install' command. If you are unfamiliar with cocoapods there is a 'noPods' branch of this project that directly integrates project dependencies. 

Documentation outlining how this project is setup can be found in the ROXIMITY SDK documentation files [here](http://app.roximity.com/beacons/documentation)
